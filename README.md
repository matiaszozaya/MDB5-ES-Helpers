# MDB Helpers for ES Modules

## 📌 Overview
This repository provides a collection of helper functions to simplify the manipulation of [Material Design for Bootstrap (MDB)](https://mdbootstrap.com/) components in ES module-based environments. Since MDB v5 introduced modularization, handling its components properly requires specific initialization steps. These helpers ensure seamless interaction with various MDB components, including tricky ones like **Select** and **Forms**.
